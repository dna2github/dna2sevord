### How human learn some concept?

1. memorize a map between `Input` and `Output`
2. gradually forget some details inside the map (how generic works)
3. memorize more paris of (`Input`, `Output`)
4. cluster maps by similar `Output`s and interacts with the details (for example, there are lots of paths from `Input` to `Output` and we can add/remove/modify some of paths; where it may call memory mixure)
5. when `Input` comes, we can get a synthesized `Output`

### self-growth model

(thinking ...)
